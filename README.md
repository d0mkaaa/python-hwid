# python-hwid
This is a simple HWID Checker, as well included a script which would print you the HWID if you need to get it.

The main action file is the well hwid.py
The gethwid.py file is for getting your hwid.

There are no special packages for you to install to use this, since as I said it's simple.

I added some support with Hastebin.
